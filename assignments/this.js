/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding

        This type of binding sets the context of the "this" keyword to the 'window,'
        which is, essentially, the outer-most scoped object of JavaScript.

* 2. Implicit Binding

        This type of binding automatically sets the context of the "this" keyword to
        whatever object directly precedes the dot in the invocation of a function.
        For instance, in the function invocation "myObj.sayHello('Tico')", the 
        "this" keyword is referring to the "myObj".

* 3. Explicit Binding

        This type of binding requires manually setting (by the developer) the context
        of the "this" keyword with JavaScript's '.call()' and '.apply' methods.

* 4. New Binding

        This type of binding sets the context of the "this" keyword to the specific
        instance of the object that has been created and returned by the constructor
        function.
